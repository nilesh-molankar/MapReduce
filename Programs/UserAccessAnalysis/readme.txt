This program demonstrates how MapReduce can be used 
to analyse server logs. The server log used for this 
demonstration was generated in a Ruby program which I wrote,
that uses the Faker gem to generate fake data. In this case,
an IPV4 address and a time-stamp has been generated.

The Ruby script is also included in the source folder.
