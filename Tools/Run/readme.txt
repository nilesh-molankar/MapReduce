**********************************README FOR RUN.JAVA**********************************

The Run tool will accept file names as command line arguments. It will then execute all
command found within those files, one file at a time. Command line arguments must be 
given as one command per line. Commands.txt is provided as a sample file for testing.

Instructions:

1. Save Run.java to desired directory (you can keep it wherever you like)

2. To use, you can can just call the Run.class file included in the Tools folder. 
Alternatively, you can compile first by running "javac Run.java" from command line in 
the directory where you saved Rn.java previously. 

3. Now execute the class file by running "java Run <file_name.txt>... <file_name.txt>
You can pass as many file names as you like to the Run tool, but you must pass at least 
one argument

4. The log file for your current run will be saved to RunLog.txt in the same directory 
as Run.class
